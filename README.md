# neural-network-zero-to-hero

This repository contains my work and notes for the first four parts of the [AI Neural Network Course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) by Andrej Karpathy.

## Course Overview

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of neural networks and deep learning. It is divided into several parts, and this repository focuses on the first four:

1. **The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd**
2. **The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore**
3. **Building makemore Part 2: MLP**
4. **Building makemore Part 3: Activations & Gradients, BatchNorm**

## Google Colab

All the course work and exercises are implemented in Google Colab notebooks. Google Colab is a free cloud service that provides an environment to write, run, and share code. It's especially suited for machine learning and data analysis.

## Work in Progress

Please note that this repository is currently a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to progress through the course. Stay tuned for more updates!
